# Quest Productivity(QP)
A desktop application for enhancing productivity
-----------------------------------------
# Mission
Like many others, I sometimes find doing all my tasks and chores for the day difficult, and often leave things for the future. This ends up piling up more work, and therefore making it even HARDER to start on what I want to get done. Something that I personally have started doing to help myself get past this, is by writing everything I want to get done the next day before I go to bed. 

This process has helped me a lot. I've been finding myself with a lot more time to do things such as; pick up personal projects, hang out with friends, and excersize more. However, despite this, I realize that writing everything down the day before is not the most efficient way to go about this. Not only does this usually take me about 15 minutes to think about how to best partition my tasks, but I also have to worry about the order. That's not even mentioning the fact that plans can change, and I can suddenly have to move things around.

That's why I'm making Quest Productivity: an electron powered desktop application that allows me to make and partition daily planners efficiently and flexibly, as well as keep track of personal statistics.
